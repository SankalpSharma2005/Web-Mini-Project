# Web-Mini-Project
**Group Members - Sankalp Sharma(23BCT0245), Priyal Chamaria(23BCE2100)**
We were assigned Q5 for the web mini project to create a website on VIT infrastructure facilities, covering various blocks and cells. We built this website from scratch using HTML and CSS. This is the half-completed frontend. Additional HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components will be added before the final submission.
