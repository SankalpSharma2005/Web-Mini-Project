**Group Members - Sankalp Sharma(23BCT0245), Priyal Chamaria(23BCE2100)**

We were assigned Q5 for the web mini project to create a website on VIT infrastructure facilities, covering various blocks and cells. We built this website from scratch using HTML and CSS. This is the half-completed frontend. Additional HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components will be added before the final submission.

Let's understasnd the website

1. We made a VIT infrastructure website, on clicking on segments like Home, Facilities and About, you will be directed to respective segments on page.

2. When you click on "View Details", you will be redirected to respective webpages of academic blocks.

3. The webpages for each academic block provide details about their facilities, including information on various labs, smart classrooms, and auditoriums located on different floors.(to be added for the final review).

4. The home button on academic block's weebpage navigates to the main infrastructure page.

5. The social media icons in the "About" section provide direct links to their respective official social media handles.

6. We have also uploaded the file that is uploaded on VTOP with pictures.
